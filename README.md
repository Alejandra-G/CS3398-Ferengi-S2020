# Personal Budget App
### The team (Alex, Courtney, Shay, Scott, and Ryan) will be creating a personalized budgeting app for individual users to keep track of the user's income, expenses, savings, and financial goals we think would be helpful to the user. The user could be anyone looking to be more financially conscious. We are doing this in an attempt to help young/college students learn to manage their mmoney more effectively. It is not a skill that is readily taught and is often a hard learned lesson with many negative impacts that can arise (debt, low credit score, collections, wage garnishing). We want to make it easy and fun to manage money to build life skills that a person will use and teach/show to their kids.
